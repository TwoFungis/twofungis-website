### STEP 1: Check What GoDaddy Hosting You Have

## IF YOU HAVE "WEBSITE BUILDER":

**BAD NEWS:** Website Builder is locked down - you CAN'T upload custom files.

**YOUR OPTIONS:**
1. **Upgrade to Web Hosting** (~$5-10/month) - Do this in GoDaddy
2. **Use free Netlify** instead (better than GoDaddy, FREE forever)
3. **Keep domain forwarding** to Emergent for now

## 🎯 TELL ME RIGHT NOW:

**What hosting type shows in your GoDaddy account?**

Once you tell me, I'll give you EXACT steps for YOUR situation!

## IF YOU WANT TO USE FREE NETLIFY INSTEAD:

**This is honestly better than GoDaddy AND free:**

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. I'll prepare your files
3. You drag & drop them
4. Point your GoDaddy domain to Netlify
5. Done! FREE forever

**This takes 10 minutes and costs $0.**
